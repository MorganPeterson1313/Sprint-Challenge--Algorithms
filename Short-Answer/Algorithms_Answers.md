#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) this one looks linear O(n) because of its number of operations


b) O(n)


c) O(1^n) because of the recursive call

## Exercise II


The middle of building is equal to the lowest floor plus highest floor divided by 2
if the the length of the building is equal to 0 then there is no building
if the middle of the buildig is equal to the floor (f) we are looking for then we have found the right floor
if the middle of the building is greater than the floor (f) we are looking for then
search through the building for the floor using the lowest floor and the middle of the building +1




runtime is equal to O(1^n) because it implements recursion once
